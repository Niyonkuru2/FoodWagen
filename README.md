# 🍔 **FoodWagen – A2SV Technical Interview Project**

**FoodWagen** is a responsive and accessible food management web application built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to view, search, add, edit, and delete food items while maintaining clean UI consistency and robust state management.  

This project was developed as part of the **A2SV Technical Interview Assessment**, focusing on translating Figma designs into functional web applications with strong attention to code structure, performance, and maintainability.

---

## 📘 **Project Overview**

FoodWagen demonstrates core frontend engineering principles, including:  
- Translating design specifications into high-quality, reusable UI components.  
- Managing asynchronous operations with a real-world API.  
- Implementing form validation, error handling, and loading states.  
- Following accessibility and naming conventions for scalability and clarity.  

The project integrates with a **mock REST API** and includes unit tests covering rendering, user interaction, and API mocking.

## 🌐 **API Integration**

The project consumes the mock API below to manage food and restaurant data:

```
Base URL: https://6852821e0594059b23cdd834.mockapi.io/Food
```

### Endpoints
- **GET /Food** – Retrieve all food items  
- **GET /Food?name=[query]** – Filter foods by name  
- **POST /Food** – Create a new food item  
- **PUT /Food/:id** – Update existing food data  
- **DELETE /Food/:id** – Delete a food item

## ⚙️ **Core Components**

| Component | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| **FoodCard** | Displays food details and restaurant info |
| **SearchBar** | Filters food items based on user query |
| **AddFoodModal** | Adds a new food item with validation |
| **EditFoodModal** | Edits an existing food item |
| **DeleteFoodModal** | Confirms and deletes selected food |
| **InputField** | Reusable and accessible input component |

## 🧾 **Form Validation & Error Handling**

Each form field is validated based on the provided guidelines.  
Error messages are user-friendly and accessible via ARIA attributes.

| Field | Validation | Error ID | Message |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Food Name | Required | `food-name-error` | *Food Name is required* |
| Food Rating | 1–5 range | `food-rating-error` | *Food Rating must be a number between 1 and 5* |
| Food Image URL | Required | `food-image-error` | *Food Image URL is required* |
| Restaurant Name | Required | `restaurant-name-error` | *Restaurant Name is required* |
| Restaurant Logo URL | Required | `restaurant-logo-error` | *Restaurant Logo URL is required* |
| Restaurant Status | Must be “Open Now” or “Closed” | `restaurant-status-error` | *Restaurant Status must be ‘Open Now’ or ‘Closed’* |

## 🧪 **Testing**

Testing ensures stability, correctness, and reliability of critical features.  

### Coverage Includes:
1. **Component Rendering:** Ensures components render correctly with given props.  
2. **User Interaction:** Tests button clicks and form submissions.  
3. **API Mocking:** Verifies both success and error states of API requests.

Run tests with:
```bash
npm run test
```

All network calls are **mocked** using Jest and React Testing Library.
